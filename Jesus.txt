So imagine this, a company that's been around forever. Long history. Strong HR department (Compliance Division [the Law]). Everyone's under strict policy, with senior consultants (prophets) occasionally dropping memos from the Head Office (Heaven Corp). The Boss? Nobody's seen Him. Not really. There's a legendary executive suite (corner office in the sky), but most employees just know the rules and do their jobs.

Then...

The Boss's son arrives...

One day, a new guy shows up. Young. No fancy suit. No entourage. Comes in like a regular intern quiet, humble. People ask, "New hire?" But he says, "Actually... I'm the Boss... the Boss's Son."

Confusion erupts.

Some whisper, "Nepotism."

Others say, "Prove it."

He starts doing things only the Boss can do, walks into the restricted executive suite (the Temple), like he owns it, Signs off orders without middle management approval, cancels meetings with disruptive consultants (demons) tells them to leave, ixes corrupted company files and employee records (heals people's broken lives), speaks with complete authority, like he wrote the employee handbook.

People start murmuring, "Is this guy... actually from the Head Office?"


At one point, he walks into the company cafeteria. Food shortage. So, the office cafeteria's swamped. It's late. No food prepped. The lunch crew already clocked out. People are starving. Productivity is dropping. HR's getting complaints.

Then the Boss's Son walks in.

Doesn't panic

He pulls out a clearance card—Level: "B.O.S.S."

He taps into the internal Executive Ordering System, one that hasn't been used since Moses' team got emergency food deliveries (Manna Drops). This system bypasses kitchen staff, inventory approvals, even supply chain limitations.

He places a mass order directly from the Executive Reserves.

He also checked in with the Head Office (prayed to God) for guidance and approval.

Suddenly, catering trucks roll in.
Stacks of bread. Fish. Enough for thousands of employees.

People are stunned.

"Wait. Who even has the ability to place orders at that level?"

"That's not available to us."

"You'd need the Boss's password."

Some employees are now whispering, "He's got the password. That's gotta mean something."

BUT OTHERS AREN'T HAVING IT
A few senior staff members frown, that

"That doesn't prove anything. He probably hacked the system."

"Real authority doesn't operate that fast."

"If he was really from the Head Office, he'd have come with more… prestige. Not sandals."

They ignore the food. Keep eating from vending machines.

Meanwhile, hundreds of interns and overlooked employees are now following him around the building, hoping for more drops, but also curious:

"Who is this guy?"


Then he starts giving internal training sessions across departments, love the workers and even the rivals, the last intern can be promoted above the supervisor, don't just follow the rules—live the intent, the Boss isn't distant—He wants relationship, not just compliance.
He wasn't pitching a rebellion, he was revealing the original company culture, long buried under bureaucracy and pride.


Then middle management feels threatened. The Pharisee Department, Sadducee Legal, and the Sanhedrin Board. They say

"If this guy really is the Boss's Son, our departments become redundant."

So they launch an internal investigation.

They try to catch him violating company policy—fixing employee issues during mandatory downtime (healing on rest days), talking to lower-tier employees (sinners), overriding company protocol (laws). But he never breaks the rules, he just fulfills the intent behind them.

That scares them more.




Eventually, they accuse him of insubordination and identity fraud.

They pull in Corporate Security (Rome Division) and say:

"This guy is starting a rebellion. He's saying he's the real Boss."

Corporate Security (Rome Division) doesn't care about office politics. But if someone's threatening company control? That's treason.

Of course, as the Boss's Son, he technically couldn't be fired. But middle management, threatened by his authority, pulled strings, filed enough complaints, and convinced Corporate Security to override normal protocol. They staged a public termination, one that would send a message to everyone.

They didn't just deactivate his badge, they wiped his profile from the system, sent a company wide memo shaming him, and made sure everyone saw his "termination" as a warning (crucifixion).



So after the Son gets fired publicly access revoked, profile deleted, everyone assumes that's it. No one comes back from that kind of firing.

Why?

Because he didn't just get laid off.

He was sent to the Termination Floor, the place in Corporate nobody talks about. It's where every contract breach, permanent ban, and final legal record is filed away. It's HR's graveyard of ex-employees. Even people with the best appeals lawyers never got back in once they were filed down there.

But here's what no one knew, the Son wasn't just an employee, he was also the Chief Legal Architect of the whole company. He helped write the policy manual before there was even an org chart.

So when he gets sent down to the Legal Archives?

He doesn't go as a victim.

He goes with override credentials.

He finds the Master Termination Ledger, the file that gives the Offboarding Division (Death) the authority to keep people permanently off the books.

And he revokes it.

He updates the global contract terms.

Deletes the debt logs.

Changes the access settings.

Takes back the Master Keys.

Now the system itself recognizes his override authority, and the rules of permanent termination get rewritten from the inside.


What they didn't know?
This was the plan all along.
The Boss and the Son had a private meeting before he ever walked into the building. The Son was sent not just to fix the system, but to open up access for every employee, restoring lost benefits, clearing old HR violations, and making it possible for anyone, from intern to executive, to have a direct line to the Head Office.
He wasn't just there to patch up company policy, he came to rewrite the employee handbook so everyone could be included in the new company plan.
To do that, someone had to take the full disciplinary action. Not a temp. Not a manager. Only someone with full executive authority.
So the Son voluntarily accepted the ultimate deactivation (let the system kill him).



Three days after the firing, his badge scans active again.

Employees freak out.
"He's back?! How?"

He starts appearing in break rooms, walking through locked doors, holding team meetings. Telling them
"I beat the system. The reset is live. Anyone who believes in me? You're in the new company plan. Full access. No more fear of being terminated."



Then he tells his team
"I'm going back to Head Office. But I'm sending a Helper from the Remote Guidance Division (Holy Spirit). You'll have my authority on Site. Run the company right. I'll be back for the full merger."


The Son of the Boss came down and did the job perfectly.
Middle management hated him for exposing the flaws in the system.
He took the fall, broke into the Legan Archives, reset the system from within.
Now all employees can be promoted to board members (co-heirs), with a permanent seat at the Board if they trust the Son's plan and believe that he is the Boss.
